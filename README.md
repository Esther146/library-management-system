# library-management-system
A library management system based on Queue Priority and also based on FIFO
This is the library management system built with Java Collection Framework. 
In the first implementation: 
Librarian lends book to users based on PRIORITY. Here I made use of Queue and PriorityQueue to pick the objects based on prioity.

In the second implementation:
The Librarian lends book using FIFO (First In First Out) Queue. ie According the Queue/line(Line by Line without having a priority or preference). 
I made use of List and LinkedList to arrange the objects in the Queue.
